create a new file or edit an existing file
git add file
git commit
git push --rebase origin master (which is your branch on github)
git push -set-upstream origin own-branch (which is your local branch)


after change of default branch from 'main' to 'own-branch'
It is now very simple and fast to pull any changes directly to own-branch:

make some changes on files or create some new files
git commit -a
git push origin own-branch

So on github you can find the changes directly, no steps for merge into old default branch :)
